# Blackboard Simulation

The project is designed to implement a client-server application using java to store student grades in a database.  By creating a course, the instructor would be able to enroll students in the course, edit or change the grading scheme, upload student grades and edit or delete the course. The instructor is able to print a report that shows the student progress report and the grade report. After an instructor creates a class, the students enrolled in the class would be able to view their grades and assignments.

## Getting Started

If you wish view the program action obviously you will need Java installed. There are two jar files you will need to run Client.jar, and Server.jar. The Client functionality obviously will not work without the Server running. Also you will need h2-1.3.154.jar, and defaultDB.sql for the database to function this jar file does not need to be run.

Here are some sample logins to use: tprof, jFrase both have a password of test
